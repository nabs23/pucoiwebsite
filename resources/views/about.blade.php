					<p>The PUCOI logo is composed of three symbolic parts: a dome,
					three pillars and a minaret.</p>

					<p>The dome, which is considered to be the masjid’s pinnacle,
						symbolizes the ultimate goal of the organization—that of
					establishing an ideal, balanced and harmonious Islamic society.</p>

					<p>The three pillars represent the organization’s three core values
						of excellence, partnership and service. These pillars also serve
						as the solid foundations upon which the organization’s dreamed
					Islamic society is to be built and raised.</p>

					<p>The minaret, a mosque tower from which the Muslims are
						called to prayer, stands for the organization. And like the
						Muaddhin, the members of the organization live with the
						mission of calling their fellow Muslims to prayer and ultimately,
					towards the establishment of the ideal Islamic society.</p>
